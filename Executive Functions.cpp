    Adaptable Thinking
    Adaptable thinking gives a child the ability to problem solve or adjust to situations when necessary and overcome instantaneous obstacles.This skill also applies to a child’s ability to see things from someone else’s perspective.A child who exhibits this type of cognitive thinking isn’t stumped by everyday hurdles or a difference in opinion.An example of adaptable thinking is a child who encounters a roadblock on their walk to school and devises an alternate route.

    Planning
    A child’s ability to think about the future, create a plan of action, and prioritize the different working parts is a strong sign of cognitive development.Planning skills allow a child to make a list of operations designed to effectively accomplish a taskand to adequately determine which aspects are the most important.Some examples of planning are making a packing list, giving directions, or writing a recipe.

    Self - Monitoring
    Self - monitoring involves a child’s ability to self - evaluate or comprehend how well he or she is performing a specific task.Self - monitoring helps children track and reflect on their progress regarding a specific assignment and understand that adjustments may need to be made to accomplish the task at hand.An example of positive self - monitoring is when a child identifies that a mathematics formula isn’t producing the desired results, and checks their work to discover the error.

    Self - Control
    Self - control addresses a child’s ability to restrain from physical or emotional outbursts.Impulse control keeps a child from reacting or acting without thinking, while emotional control helps a child to remain calmand resist the urge to overreact or shutdown due to criticism or obstacles.An example of effective self - control in terms of executive function is when a child receives a disappointing score on a test, but maintains focusand absorbs the constructive criticism while staying level - headed and learning from the mistakes.

    Working Memory
    Working memory involves a child’s ability to retain and store learned information and then later put it to use.This skill is crucial to a child’s success in the classroom, as it is responsible for short - term memory and execution.A strong working memory is exhibited by a child who successfully remembers and executes the instructions for a step - by - step drill in gym class.

    Time Management
    Time management concerns a child’s ability to properly organize a schedule, complete tasks on time, and maintain patience throughout assignments.Time management is imperative for a child in an array of scenarios as it facilitates the ability to jump from task to taskand enhances productivity, punctuality, and goal setting skills.An example of good time management is the completion of a multi - step project before the deadline without rushing or compromising on quality.

    Organization
    Organization skills addresses a child’s ability to efficiently arrange materials or thoughts in an orderly fashion.Organization is vital to a child’s growth and development as it allows them to tell a succinct story or keep track of possessions.Efficient organization is displayed when a child designates a distinct folder or notebook to each school subject or consistently maintains any sort of systematic method.
